\begin{slide}{Passive Monitoring}
 Passive monitoring analyzes traffic with the intention of being non-disruptive to the transmission of the traffic. Typically used
 in environments where high-network-availability is critical. This is typical in many coporate environments where the network supports
 a considerably large user base. As such, there are numerous solutions out there which provide passive network and host monitoring.
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Levels of Network Monitoring}
 There are various approaches to network monitoring which range from basic "flow data" to full packet capture, and even beyond.
 {\small \begin{description}
  \item[Flow data] Logs per-packet endpoint information, optionally including packet sizes. Common for aggregate reporting to determine
                   activity anomolies between your network and specific external or internal hosts.
  \item[Transaction data] Logs deeper connection-level information, which may span multiple packets within a connection. Must have pre-defined
                          templates for protocol formatting. Common for logging HTTP header/request information, SMTP command data, etc.
  \item[Alert data] Typically the result of finely-tuned signatures matching against packet content, and similar in nature to transaction data. This
                    information, rather than being for logging purposes is intended to indicate discrete events which might be attacks.
 \end{description}}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Levels of Network Monitoring 2}
 {\small \begin{description}
  \item[Packet capture] Full capture of packet-level contents (sometimes called \textbf{pcap}). This is roughly identical to what the OS sees on
                        the wire
  \item[Reassembly] Beyond packet-level capture, this functionality involves transport/application recognition and can reassemble IP packets into
                    TCP stream data, or even parse application-level communications to rebuild a conversation, file transfer, or even email.
 \end{description}}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Flow Data}
 Per-packet statistics, sometimes including connection/packet-counting. The goal of this is to determine how much traffic (either counts or bytes)
 is \textbf{flowing} into or out of a particular host. Distributed across the network and combined with centralized aggregation of data from many
 sensors, you can build a picture of your network to help you identify "high traffic" entities which might indicate a problem (such as active data
 theft).

  \item[netstat] With \texttt{-s/--statistics} option on Linux (\texttt{-m} on BSD \& MacOS X) can report host-local flow information per interface. Endpoints
                 could log this info at regular intervals to centralized system to build endpoint flow database.

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Transaction Data}
 Sometimes lumped into \textbf{flow data} category. However, we will make the distinction that transaction data requires sensor-level parsing
 that is traditionally not included in the base OS. For instance, transaction-level monitoring might involve parsing the \textbf{Referer} header
 from HTTP traffic, usernames from FTP or Telnet traffic, or any other metadata which must be parsed via a prepared recipe, but gets reported while
 associated traffic may be discarded after parsing is complete.
