\begin{slide}{Virtual Hosting}
 Similar to the network partitioning schemes described previously, there exist a menu of options that
 enable a single piece of server hardware to be paritioned so as to provide varying levels of isolation
 to the applications and users served by this hardware.
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Common Virt. Hosting Schemes}
 Virtual hosting methods to be covered:
 \begin{description}
  \item[Environment:] Apache virtual-hosting, Java VM
  \item[OS Level:] chroot, Jails, User-mode-Linux
  \item[Hypervisors:] VirtualBox, VMWare, Xen
  \item[Emulation:] Bochs, VMWare \& VirtualBox under special configuration
 \end{description}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Environment Virtual Hosting}
 In {\em Environment Virtual Hosting}, virtualization of the hosted applications are configured within
 the space of another application instance (typically a parent instance).
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Environment Virtual Hosting (cont.)}
 Generally the following ground rules are true:
 {\small\begin{itemize}
  \item The administrator of the server hardware has full visibility and control inside the virtual environments
  \item The virtual applications may share, privileges, storage and RAM, unless specifically configured not to
  \item Virtual processes are still visible to each other on the server-side
  \item The shared nature of the infrastructure is generally opaque to the end-user, but counter-measures must be 
        authored into the applications in order to ensure this remains true.
  \item Compromising one virtual server can put all other virtual servers at risk
 \end{itemize}}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{OS-Level Virtual Hosting}
 With OS-Level virtualization, you set up independent deployments of whole application stacks
 which cannot share each others' configurations, libraries, modules, etc. Configuration of the
 virtual environments hosting these deployments will either be configured at the supervisor OS
 level, or via specialized "no return" system calls which request that the OS isolate all future
 execution and child processes.
 \par
 In the case of \textbf{User Mode Linux}, a wholly-contained execution environment is created to
 run a different Linux kernel as a subprocess of a parent kernel, as a new application.
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{OS-Level Virtual Hosting (cont.)}
 Provides the following features beyond the \textbf{Environment} virtual hosting
 {\small\begin{itemize}
  \item Can be rooted at a sub-path in the filesystem, restricted from reads/writes outside
        of this zone
  \item Requires a dedicated instance of the service for each virtual host
  \item Lacks dedicated allocation, still competes for system resources,
        but executes with significantly limited visibility to other services
  \item Individual applications need not be specially configured, and will be relatively
        isolated from one another
  \item Networking and IPC may still be possible between isolation environments
 \end{itemize}}

 Extra cost is incurred by duplicating applications which were shared under application-level virtual hosting
