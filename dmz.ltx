\begin{slide}{DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ)}
 \textbf{Korea}: Example of a real-life DMZ. The 150-mile wide Korean DMZ was established between north and south
  Korea in an agreement to halt the fighting in the Korean War, in 1953. Access by either country to
  the DMZ is tightly controlled, while the DMZ itself is closely monitored for unauthorized intrusion.

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Purpose}
 Both North \& South Korean geo-political interests are served by establishing this DMZ. The purpose of
 this "land barrier" is to maintain a buffer zone between both countries so as to make it nearly impossible
 to pass from one country to another.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Access to North Korea is limited primarily to residents, as well as its geo-political allies to the north, namely: China \& Russia
  \item Access to South Korea is restricted primarily to residents, as well as its geo-political allies, who mostly are transported by sea, such
        as from Japan and the USA.
 \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Network DMZ}
 Similar methodology can be applied to network design, especially using the router + firewall example from earlier, with the exception that
 we can also utilize a network "DMZ" as a parition in which to host systems.
 {\footnotesize \begin{itemize}
  \item Within the DMZ, systems have tightly-controlled access to the rest of the corporate network.
  \item Access to the Internet may or may not be as tightly controlled as it is for the corporate network.
  \item If an attacker intrudes upon the DMZ, they only have access to other DMZ-based servers, but not necessarily private corporate systems
  \item Targeted monitoring \& instrumentation around the perimeter of the DMZ may assist in detecting and responding to adversary
        activity within the DMZ as they attempt to scan this environment, with minimal exposure to the actual sensitive resources.
 \end{itemize}}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{The Internet: Just a big network}
 The Internet is conceptually just a big network containing "everyone else", and therefore can fit into one side of our earlier diagram
