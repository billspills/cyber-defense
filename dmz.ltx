\begin{slide}{DeMilitarized Zone (DMZ)}
 \textbf{Korea}: Example of a real-life DMZ. The 150-mile wide Korean DMZ was established between north and south
  Korea in an agreement to halt the fighting in the Korean War, in 1953. Access by either country to
  the DMZ is tightly controlled, while the DMZ itself is closely monitored for unauthorized intrusion.

\begin{slide}{Purpose}
 Both North \& South Korean geo-political interests are served by establishing this DMZ. The purpose of
 this "land barrier" is to maintain a buffer zone between both countries so as to make it nearly impossible
 to pass from one country to another.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Access to North Korea is limited primarily to residents, as well as its geo-political allies to the north, namely: China \& Russia
  \item Access to South Korea is restricted primarily to residents, as well as its geo-political allies, who mostly are transported by sea, such
        as from Japan and the USA.
 \end{itemize}
