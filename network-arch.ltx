\maketitle

\begin{slide}{Network Topology}
 For the sake of this course, we will focus on switched (or bridged) networksdesigned to the "Star" topology.
 99\% of networks you will encounter are Star-topology networks, and this course is intended to be an overview of
 cyber defense principles to apply in design and analysis of networks.
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Device Terminology}
 Key device terms to be used in this course
 \begin{description}
  \item[Bridge] Interconnects multiple devices, enabling them to communicate directly with one another on a common network.
  \item[Router] "A router is used to route data packets between two networks."\cite{CompTech:NetGuide:NetDevs}
  \item[Firewall] "Firewalls are mainly used as a means to protect an organization's internal network from those on the outside (internet)." "Firewalls are also used to limit the access of individuals on the internal network to services on the internet along with keeping track of what is done through the firewall."\cite{CompTech:NetGuide:Firewalls}
 \end{description}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Device Terminology (cont.)}
 Key device terms to be used in this course
 \begin{description}
  \item[Server] A device installed on the network which is providing resources to users with access to that network
  \item[Gateway] "A gateway can translate information between different network data formats or network architectures"\cite{CompTech:NetGuide:NetDevs}
  \item[Endpoint] Used to describe a computer, typically a PC, on the network which is regularly connecting a user to the network, and possibly the Internet.
 \end{description}
\end{slide}

%\begin{slide}{Network Models}
% Two most commonly used network models
% \begin{description}
%  \item[OSI Model] Seven layer architecture, each layer is considered to be responsible for a different part of the communications.\cite{CompTech:NetGuide:NetProtoLevels}
%  \begin{enumerate}
%   \item Physical Layer
%   \item Data Link Layer
%   \item Network Layer
%   \item Transport Layer
%   \item Session Layer
%   \item Presentation Layer
%   \item Application Layer
%  \end{enumerate}
% \end{description}

%\begin{slide}{Network Models (cont.)}
% Two most commonly used network models
% \begin{description}
%  \item[DOD Model] Four layer architecture, originally designed for the Dept. of Defense.\cite{CompTech:NetGuide:NetProtoLevels} We will sometimes use this as
%                   a short-hand model for describing TCP/IP networks.
%   \begin{enumerate}
%    \item Link Layer
%    \item Network Layer
%    \item Transport Layer
%    \item Application Layer
%   \end{enumerate}

\begin{slide}{Switched networks}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item In a switched network, everyone connected to the same switch (a bridge) can identify everyone else connected to it, but only
   the two endpoints of a coversation may observe the content of that traffic.
  \item The switch will negotiate with each device physically connected to the switch to determine what host addresses are accessible
   on the connected port, and the switch will retain a record of these. This enables multiple switches to maintain internal pictures
   of the network, when interconnected.
 \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Example Network "A"}
 A "primary" corporate network. A1 can talk to A3, without A2 or A4 being able to see the content.

 \end{figure}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Example Network "B"}
 A "remote", secondary corporate network. B2 can talk to B1 directly.
 \begin{figure}
  \epsfig{file=2user-net.eps,height=2.25in}
 \end{figure}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Routing between the two}
 Join the two networks via a Router
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Router can observe all traffic from any host in one network communicating with any host in another network
  \item Architectural "choke point" \& partitioning tool
  \item Architectural "visibility" enforcement tool
  \item While a firewall is a separate concept, modern routers typicall incorporate firewalls within the same box
 \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Routing A to B}
 Join example "A" to "B" so that users on each network may communicate with one another. Still two partitioned networks,
 but we've added functionality to "route" certain traffic types to each one.
 \begin{figure}
  \epsfig{file=router-1.eps,height=1.75in}
 \end{figure}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Adding Firewalls}
 Firewalls can perform traffic inspection to determine if certain traffic should even be routed to the remote network, and
 vice-versa.

 There are now \textbf{4 partitions} to the network, after the addition of the two firewalling points.

\begin{slide}{Further Reading}
 This course is intended as a broad overview, with some advanced proficiency in networking expected. Further research on
 the details of Internet technology, networking data structures, and general networking topics:
