\begin{slide}{Threat Landscape}
 The \textbf{Threat Landscape} refers to the risks against your network. This can be described, in part, using the following:
 {\small\begin{itemize}
  \item Known groups with a history of targeting your network (incl. its users) [confirmed]
  \item The tools previously used to target your network [confirmed]
  \item Known groups actively targeting your business sector, area of research, partners, etc. \& the tools they are reported to use [suspect]
  \item Emergent groups/tools which may not yet have a recorded targeting history sufficient enough to define [potential]
  \item Current research into application vulnerabilities [potential]
  \item Geo-political trends, changes [potential]
 \end{itemize}}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Attack Surface}
 The \textbf{Attack Surface} is used to describe the geography created by the design, organization, and accesses provided to your network.
