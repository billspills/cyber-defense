\begin{slide}{Threat Landscape}
 The \textbf{Threat Landscape} refers to the risks against your network. This can be described, in part, using the following:
 {\small\begin{itemize}
  \item Known groups with a history of targeting your network (incl. its users) [confirmed]
  \item The tools previously used to target your network [confirmed]
  \item Known groups actively targeting your business sector, area of research, partners, etc. \& the tools they are reported to use [suspect]
  \item Emergent groups/tools which may not yet have a recorded targeting history sufficient enough to define [potential]
  \item Current research into application vulnerabilities [potential]
  \item Geo-political trends, changes [potential]
 \end{itemize}}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Attack Surface}
 The \textbf{Attack Surface} is used to describe the geography created by the design, organization, and accesses provided to your network. Using
 some of the partitioning and control mechansims described in the first week's presentations, you can control your attack surface such that in
 order to reach a certain objective, you force the intruder to gain presence on more than one host - increasing exposure risk, and therefore cost,
 to achieve objectives.
