\begin{slide}{Introduction}
\textbf{Active Defense} and \textbf{Prevention} are the strategies employed to prevent, obstruct, or otherwise block unwanted
access to the system. This lecture will discuss some preventative systems, an overview of their operation, as well as measures
which can be taken at the application configuration level for common services to enforce protections against undesirable access.
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Firewalls}
 IP firewalls can be used to parse the contents of packet headers and take action based upon the value of certain packet
 header fields. In a \textbf{stateful} IP firewall, one action that can be taken is to update global state variables within 
 a table which can then be used elsewhere in the firewall to conditionally apply rules/actions.
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Firewall Example}
 Some examples using Linux's \texttt{iptables}. \texttt{iptables} uses a firewall appraoch where a list of firewall rules
 are evaluated against every packet, and the first matching rule is used to determine the action to be taken. Linux supports
 a "default" action, typically either a permissive "\textbf{ACCEPT}" or restrictive "\textbf{DROP}" action.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item{\tiny\texttt{iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.4 -j ACCEPT \# Allow one client if default is DROP}}
  \item{\tiny\texttt{iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT \# Allow an entire network}}
  \item{\tiny\texttt{iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6881 -j ACCEPT \# Allow all hosts on a certain port}}
 \end{itemize}

\begin{slide}{Proxy Servers}
 A \textbf{proxy server} is an application-level gateway which can be used to control access, hide implementation details from view,
 and add visibility to application traffic. Some example proxy servers are:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Privoxy {\tiny\texttt{\url{http://www.privoxy.org/}}}
  \item Squid {\tiny\texttt{\url{http://www.squid-cache.org/}}}
  \item Apache mod\_proxy {\tiny\texttt{\url{http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html}}}
 \end{itemize}
